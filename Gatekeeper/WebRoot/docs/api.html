        The Gatekeeper web service handles all authentication from incoming requests.
        </p></hr>
        <p>The following are the Use Cases for the Gatekeeper:</p>
        <li>
        If the user submits only BASIC authentication credentials, a token will be
        generated and returned upon completion of the requested query.
        </li>
        <li>
        If the user submits a token, the token will be used provided it does not
        exceed the time to live. In that event, a ServletException is thrown.
        </li>
        <li>
        If no credentials or tokens are submitted, a token for special user public
        will be created and the remainder of the query will be done as public. The
        response will return a public token.
        </li>
        <hr><p>There is no explicit API for interacting with the Gatekeeper as a service.
        The requirement for all services is using a basic Authorization header.
        Once a cookie is received from a request, using that cookie instead of the
        Authorization header will result in being able to interact with all pasta
        services without transferring user authentication credentials until the cookie
        expires or the user determines it necessary to authenticate using alternative
        credentials.</p></hr>
        <p>The following services can be used in conjunction with the Gatekeeper:
        <li><a href="http://package.lternet.edu/package/docs/api">DataPackageManager</a> @ http://pasta.lternet.edu/package/</li>
        <li>GatekeeperTester @ http://pasta.lternet.edu/test</li>
        <!--
        <li><a href="http://event.lternet.edu/eventmanager/docs/api">EventManager</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://factory.lternet.edu/metadatafactory/docs/api">MetadataFactory</a></li>
        -->
        </p>
        <!--
        <p>It is recommended to explore DataPackageManager's functionality as
        EventManager and MetadataFactory's infrastructure has not been revised to
        operate with cookies at present.</p>
