                      <p>Research methods</p>
                      <p>The Daily Water Sample program was started in 1978 to moniter the daily
                        nutrient cycling within the North Inlet Estuary System. The original
                        sampling site was at Town Creek. Later samples were taken at Clambank and
                        Oyster Landing as well. Samples were taken 365 days a year at the same time
                        every day, approximately 10:00 AM EST. The samples were filtered at the Lab
                        to separate the particulates from the water. The filtered water was then run
                        through a colorimeter and the nutrient value peak heights derived were
                        recorded on a ticker tape type printout. These values were recorded into a
                        master nutrient note book, and entered onto a CMS file by the Data
                        Management Department at the lab. The filters that were used in the
                        filtering process were first weighted, burnt off and cleaned, then they were
                        weighted with the particulates dried onto them. These filters were then
                        cooked again for 24 hours at 450 degrees. This was done to determine the
                        inorganic particulates that were left. All data files have since been stored
                        on a SUN workstation and backed up on 8mm tapes at both the field lab and
                        the data management office at the University of South Carolina.</p>
                      <p>Analysis methods for the individual variables are described below:</p>
                      <p>Ortho-Phosphate</p>
                      <p>The basic method was the Technicon Industrial Method No. 155-71W (1973),
                        which was a modification of the Murphy and Riley (1962) single solution
                        method. The method depended on the formation of a phospomolybdate blue
                        complex, the color of which is read at a wavelength of 880 mm.</p>
                      <p>Sulfate</p>
                      <p>For this automated procedure for sulfate (Technicon Industrial Method No.
                        118-71W/B), the sample was first passed through a cation-exchange column to
                        remove interferences. The sample containing sulfate was then reacted with
                        barium chloride at a pH of 2.5-3.0 to form barium sulfate. Excess barium
                        reacted with methylthmol blue to form a blue-colored was gray; if it was all
                        chelated with barium, the color was blue. Initially, the barium chloride and
                        methylthymol blue were equimolar and equivalent to the highest concentration
                        of sulfate ion expected; thus the amount of uncomplexed methylthymol blue,
                        measured at 460 mm, was equal to the sulfate present.</p>
                      <p>Nitrate/Nitrite</p>
                      <p>The basic method was Technicon Industrial Method No. 158-71W/B, which
                        utilized the reaction in which nitrate was reduced to nitrite by a copper-
                        cadmium reductor column. The nitrite ion then reacted with sulfanilamide
                        under acidic conditions to form a diazo compound. This compound then coupled
                        with N-1-napthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride to form a reddish-purple azo
                        dye.</p>
                      <p>Chlorides</p>
                      <p>The basic method was Technicon Industrial Method No. 99-70W/B. This
                        automated procedure for the determination of chloride depended upon the the
                        liberation of thiocyanate ion from mercuric thiocyanate by the formation of
                        unionized but soluble mercuric chloride. In the presence of ferric ion, the
                        liberated thiocyanate formed a highly colored ferric thiocyanate
                        proportional to the original chloride concentration.</p>
                      <p>Ammonia</p>
                      <p>This method was from "The Automated Analysis of Nutrients in Seawater: A
                        Manual of Techniques" by Gilbert and Loder (1977), a Woods Hole
                        Oceanographic Institution publication No. WHO-77-47. This method was
                        dependent upon the Berthelot Reaction, during which the formation of a blue
                        colored compound closely related to indophenol occurred when the solution of
                        an ammonium salt was added to sodium phenoxide, followed by the addition of
                        sodium hypochlorite. A solution of potassium sodium tartrate and sodium
                        citrate was added to the sample stream to eliminate the precipitation of the
                        hydroxides of calcium and magnesium. Total Nitrogen - Total Phosphorus The
                        procedure consisted of an alkaline persulfate oxidation followed by
                        automated analysis for nitrogen (as nitrate) and phosphorus (as phosphate)
                        on a Technicon Auto Analyzer. With alkaline persulfate digestion, all
                        nitrogen in the sample was oxidized to nitrate, which was then reduced by
                        cadmium and analyzed as nitrite. The precision and recovery of this method
                        compared favorably with a Kjeldahl procedure (D'Elia et al., 1977). The main
                        advantage of the persulfate oxidation was the speed and convenience with
                        which it was accomplished. Unlike the Kjeldahl method, which recovered only
                        organic and NH4 - nitrogen, the persulfate oxidation also included NO3 and
                        NO2 nitrogen. The procedure described by D'Elia (1977) has been so the
                        digest could be analyzed using an autoanalyzer (Gilbert et al., 1977). This
                        semi- automated procedure combined the persulfate oxidation with automated
                        nitrate and phosphate analysis to provide simultaneous analysis for total
                        persulfate nitrogen (TPN) and total persulfate phosphorus (TPP). Gilbert's
                        procedure was further modified to use a smaller sample size so that the
                        digestion flask could double as the sampler tray cup (Loder, 1978). Using
                        this method, many samples could be run quickly with a minimum of handling.
                        Carbon (prior to September 1989) Particulate Carbon 20 ml of daily water
                        sample was filtered through a precombusted (24 hr @ 450 C) Whatman GFF 0.7
                        micron glass filter. The filter was waved over concentrated HCl to eliminate
                        inorganic carbon, then placed in a precombusted ampule and frozen. Batches
                        were dried at 60 C for 48 hrs. 0.1 gr of precombusted (48 hr @ 750 C)
                        reagent grade CuO was added to each ampule, the ampule was then purged with
                        pure oxygen and sealed, using an Oceanigraphics International Purging and
                        Sealing Unit #524PS. Ampules were etched, then heated to 580 C for 4 hrs.
                        Sorted ampules were then analyzed on an Oceanigraphics International #524C
                        TOC Analyzer by comparing infrared absorption peak heights (Horiba PIR 2000)
                        on an LDC strip chart recorder with those of KHP (Potassium Hydrogen
                        Phthalate) standards. Standards were prepared by microsyringing a series of
                        volumes of a KHP solution into ampules and processing them as samples.
                        Reagent blanks were subtracted and average concentration of duplicate
                        samples was calculated for each DWS site. Dissolved Organic Carbon The daily
                        water sample was filtered through a precombusted (24 hr @ 450 C) Whatman GFF
                        0.7 micron glass filter. An aliquot of filtrate was refrigerated. Samples
                        were purged of inorganic carbon by adding 25percent phosphoric acid to lower
                        the pH to 2 and bubbling for 10 minutes with pure oxygen. The pH was then
                        neutralized using ammonium hydroxide to protect the oxidizing catalyst.
                        Every 5 minutes, using a Hamilton CR-700-200 spring loaded syringe, a 100
                        microliter sample was injected into a Beckman 915A TOC Analyzer and infrared
                        absorption peak heights were compared to those of KHP standard solutions to
                        calculate carbon concentration. Carbon (after September 1989) Dissolved
                        Organic Carbon Water samples were filtered through a precombusted Whatman
                        GFF 7.0 micron glass filter. Samples were purged of inorganic carbon by
                        adding 10 percent HCl and sparged with ultra zero grade air. A 40 microliter
                        aliquot was injected, via a autosampler, into a Shimadzu TOC-500 organic
                        carbon analyzer. A non-dispersive infrared gas analyzer was utilized to
                        measure the carbon dioxide produced and samples were run in triplicate with
                        means reported. ***NOTE*** A Whatman GFF 7.0 micron glass fiber filter was
                        used throughout the LTER Daily Water Sample analysis.</p>
