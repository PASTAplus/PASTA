The PASTA+ data repository software is actively maintained by the
`Environmental Data Initiative <https://www.environmentaldatainitiative.org>`_
(EDI), a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project through the Division
of Environmental Biology (DEB) under grants #1565103 and #1629233. EDI is
manage through the University of New Mexico and the University of Wisconsin,
with Principal Investigators Dr. Mark Servilla and Dr. Corinna Gries,
respectively. The EDI grant period of performance is from July 2016 through
June 2019. Please refer to the project's website (`here
<https://www.environmentaldatainitiative.org>`_) for more information about
the Environmental Data Initiative.


PASTA+ began as the *Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture*
(PASTA), an informatics project of the `Long Term Ecological Research
<https://www.lternet.edu>`_ (LTER) Network Office, also an NSF DEB program
(partial funding for the initial design and development of PASTA was from the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009). Design and development of
PASTA began in late 2009. Production deployment occurred in January 2013 as
the core infrastructure of the LTER Network Information System (NIS). The LTER
NIS was the de facto data repository for research data products of the LTER
Network. PASTA supported the upload and archive of ecological data packages
(science data and metadata), which consist mostly of tabular data, but may
include other products such as audio, imagery, or binary objects. PASTA
transitioned to *PASTAplus* (PASTA+) in July 2016 with the end of the LTER
Network Office and the beginning of the Environmental Data Initiative.

PASTA+ is now the core infrastructure of the EDI Data Repository and supports
environmental and ecological data products from the NSF programs for Long Term
Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB), Organization for Biological Field
Stations (OBFS), MacroSystems Biology (MSB), and Long Term Ecological Research
(LTER). The EDI Data Repository is an open archive and accepts data from most
publicly funded programs and projects within the United States of America and
beyond.
