The PASTA data repository software is actively developed and managed by the
`Environmental Data Initiative <https://edirepository.org>`_ (EDI), a National
Science Foundation (NSF) funded project through the Division of Biological
Infrastructure (DBI) under grants #2223103 and #2223104. EDI institutional
support comes from the University of Wisconsin and the University of New Mexico,
with Principal Investigators Dr. Corinna Gries and Dr. Mark Servilla,
respectively. EDI has been in operation since July 2016 and continues to provide
data publication and archive services to the environmental and ecological
science communities. Please refer to the project's website (`here
<https://edirepository.org/about/about-edi>`_) for more information about the
Environmental Data Initiative.


PASTA began as the *Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture*, an
informatics project [#pasta_funding]_ of the `Long Term Ecological
Research <https://www.lternet.edu>`_ (LTER) Network Office. Initial design and
development of PASTA began in late 2009, with the culmination of a production
deployment in January 2013 as the core infrastructure of the LTER *Network
Information System* (NIS). The LTER NIS was the de facto and exclusive data
repository for research data products of the LTER Network. PASTA supported the
upload and archive of ecological data packages (science data and metadata),
which consist mostly of tabular data, but may include other products such as
audio, imagery, or binary objects. The moniker "PASTA" transitioned to
"PASTAplus", along with dropping the acronym for the Provenance Aware Synthesis
Tracking Architecture, in July 2016 with the end of the LTER Network Office
project and the beginning of the Environmental Data Initiative.

PASTA is the core infrastructure of the EDI Data Repository and supports
environmental and ecological data products from the NSF programs for the Long
Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB), Organization for Biological
Field Stations (OBFS), MacroSystems Biology (MSB), and Long Term Ecological
Research (LTER). The EDI Data Repository is an open archive and accepts data
from publicly funded programs and projects within the United States of America
and beyond. As of July 2018, there are 42,800 unique data packages in the EDI
Data Repository. EDI also manages two Data Portals, the `EDI Data Portal
<https://portal.edirepository.org/nis>`_ and the `LTER Data Portal
<https://portal.lternet.edu/nis>`_, which interact directly with PASTA software
through its REST web-service API and serve as a reference implementations for
how to use the API in a web applications. Questions or feedback may be sent to
support@edirepository.org. The PASTA software may be accessed through our GitHub
repository at `PASTAplus/PASTA <https://github.com/PASTAplus/PASTA>`_.

.. [#pasta_funding] Funding for PASTA was derived from both the NSF DEB and the
                    American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.
