Standard Operating Procedures
=============================

The PASTA repository software stack is maintained and provided by EDI. Although
operational aspects of the repository are codified into software, many processes
are controlled through policy decisions of EDI. The following section
blends the software operation into those dictated by policy within this set of
*Standard Operating Procedures*.

Descriptions of the following SOPs are provided:

#. **Data Package Defined:** A description of a data package's components and
   how they are identified on the system disk.

#. **Data Package Life Cycle:** A detailed description of a data
   package's life cycle.

#. **Replication and Backup Strategies:** Discussion about how EDI utilizes
   replication and backup strategies to ensure all data packages are secure and
   recoverable.
