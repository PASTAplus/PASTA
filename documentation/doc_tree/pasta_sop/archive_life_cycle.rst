===============================
Data Package Archive Life-Cycle
===============================


The following documentation describes the life cycle of a
:doc:`data package </doc_tree/pasta_sop/data_package_definition>` from
the time it is submitted to the EDI data repository to the time it is
permanently archived, including the steps that are taken to ensure that all
data are backed up to both near-line and long-term storage.

The life cycle of a data package begins when its EML document is submitted to
the EDI data repository by a data provider.
