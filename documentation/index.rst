*User/Developer Documentation*
==============================

This website is the official documentation of the *LTER Network Information System* and, more specifically, the *Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture* (PASTA). The site is divided into *five* primary categories designed to inform the user of different aspects of the LTER NIS and PASTA.

To assist the weary web traveler in deciding what category to peruse, a short synopsis of each section follows:

#. **About the LTER Network Information System:** Overview and motivation for the LTER Network Information System - the LTER Data Cooperative, data producers, and data consumers.

#. **Documentation for Users of the LTER Data Portal:** The LTER Data Portal is the official web-browser interface for users to upload, search, and download LTER data products. The Data Portal is considered a reference implementation of an application that utilizes the PASTA Application Program Interface (API).

#. **Documentation for Developers using the PASTA API:** Documentation for the PASTA API and general information and suggestions for software developers who would like to build an application that interacts with the PASTA API.

#. **Documentation for PASTA Developers:** Design documentation of the PASTA framework for developers who plan on extending, fixing, refactoring the core components of PASTA and their associated web-services. Documentation for `DataONE`_'s Generic Member Node deployment and GMN's adapter for harvesting data from PASTA.

#. **General FAQ for the LTER NIS and PASTA:** A list of the most commonly asked questions and their answers about the LTER NIS and PASTA.
