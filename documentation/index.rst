This website is the official documentation of the *EDI Data Repository* and, more specifically, 
the *Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture* (PASTA). The site is divided into *five* primary 
categories designed to inform the user of different aspects of the EDI Data Repository and PASTA.

To assist the weary web traveler in deciding what category to peruse, a short synopsis of each section follows:

#. **EDI Data Repository:** Overview and motivation for the EDI Data Repository, data producers, and data consumers.

#. **EDI Data Portal Users Guide:** The EDI Data Portal is the official web-browser interface for users to upload, search, and download EDI data products. The Data Portal is considered a reference implementation of an application that utilizes the PASTA Application Program Interface (API).

#. **PASTA+ API:** Documentation for the PASTA API and general information and suggestions for software developers who would like to build an application that interacts with the PASTA API.

#. **PASTA+ Architecture:** Design documentation of the PASTA+ architecture and software development principles.

#. **General FAQ:** A list of the most commonly asked questions and their answers about the EDI Data Repository and PASTA.
