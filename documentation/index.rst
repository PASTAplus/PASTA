This is the official documentation tree of the *PASTA* data repository software.
The PASTA software and related contents is owned and maintained by the
`Environmental Data Initiative <https://edirepository.org>`_ (EDI). PASTA is a
service oriented software system written in Java and uses Java Servlet
containers for REST web-services. Services can be deployed on separate servers
for performance or deployed onto a single server for simplicity, testing, and
development. Deployments have been tested on Linux, OS X, and Windows. EDI
utilizes PASTA in its operation of the *EDI data repository*.

#. **About:** A short history of PASTA+ and how it is being used in a
   production environment.

#. **REST API:** Documentation for the PASTA API and general information and
   suggestions for software developers who would like to build an application
   that interacts with the PASTA API.
