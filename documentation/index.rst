This is the official documentation tree of the *PASTA+* data
repository software. PASTA+ is a service oriented software system written in Java and uses Java Servlet containers for REST web-services. Services can be deployed on separate servers for performance or deployed onto a single server for simplicity, testing, and development. Deployments have been tested on Linux, OS X, and Windows.

#. **About:** A short history of PASTA+ and how it is being used in a production environment.

#. **Design and Architecture:** Design documentation of the PASTA+ architecture and software development principles.

#. **REST API:** Documentation for the PASTA API and general information and suggestions for software developers who would like to build an application that interacts with the PASTA API.
