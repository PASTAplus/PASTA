    <abstract>
      <para>
  This dataset includes lake water samples collected in the summer of
  2016 from 16 different mountain lakes in the Rocky mountains in both
  Rocky Mountain National Park and the Snowy Range of southern Wyoming.
  Each lake was sampled twice: once in the early summer when hydrologic
  connections with the surrounding terrestrial environment were high and
  again in the late summer when hydrologic connections were low. The
  main goal of the study was to compare communities of bacterioplankton
  in alpine and subalpine lakes to determine if communities differed
  across treeline as soil microbes in the surrounding terrestrial
  environment were. To do so, we collected water samples from the
  deepest point of each lake, mixed it with a surface water sample and
  characterized bacterioplankton communities with 16S sequencing
  technology. Additionally, we wanted to identify abiotic factors that
  may correlate with community dissimilarity and characterized a suite
  of chemical attributes for each lake. Lake characteristics reported
  included surface temperature, soluble reactive phosphorous (SRP),
  ammonia (NH3+), pH, total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved
  phosphorus (TDP), and total dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and
  chlorophyll a (chl-a).

  Methods
</para>
          <para>
  Sample collection During the summer of 2016, we sampled 16 lakes in
  drainages that spanned treeline in the Southern Rocky Mountain
  ecoregion twice during the growing season: once at the beginning of
  summer and again near the end. The first visit was made in July, as
  early as possible after ice-off to safely access the upper most lake
  in each drainage and the second visit was made approximately five
  weeks later. Three of the four drainages were located in Rocky
  Mountain National Park (RMNP), Colorado; and the fourth was located in
  the Snowy Range of southern Wyoming (Figure 1). The Snowy Range
  drainage was chosen for comparison with RMNP lakes to determine if the
  alpine treeline pattern held in different geographic locations. Each
  drainage contained two lakes above (alpine) and two below (subalpine)
  treeline. Shrubs and tundra vegetation were present in the terrestrial
  environment surrounding the alpine lakes in all four drainages. The
  lakes range in elevation from approximately 2,800 m to 3,600 m.
  Vegetation at treeline was dominated by Engelmann spruce (Picea
  engelmannii) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta).
</para>
          <para>
  We accessed backcountry lakes by foot, and to avoid potential
  contamination of pathogens or aquatic invasive species, we sampled
  upper lakes first, and worked down the drainage to the lower elevation
  lakes. At the deepest point of each lake (accessed with an inflatable
  Alpaca raft), we recorded water temperature and the depth. We
  collected two water samples at the deepest point of the lake: one from
  the surface of the lake (grab sample) and one from approximately 1 m
  above the bottom of the lake with an acrylic Van Dorn bottle. Samples
  were collected in acid washed and triple DI rinsed 500 ml HDPE
  bottles. We mixed even volumes of the surface and the bottom samples
  to create one representative sample for each lake. All lakes within a
  drainage were sampled between the hours of 0800 and 1300 and within 36
  hours of one another to minimize potential temporal effects.
</para>
          <para>
  Sample processing Within 12 hours of collection, we hand-filtered
  between 500 ml and 1,000 ml lake water through 0.7 µm pore size glass
  fiber filters (GF/F, pre-combusted at 475o C for 4 hours) and 500 ml
  though 0.2 µm pore size sterile filters in the field. The filtrate
  (0.7 µm pore size filter) was transferred to high-density polyethylene
  (HDPE) plastic bottles and kept for water chemistry characterization.
  We transferred the 0.7 µm GF/F filters (chlorophyll-a samples) and 0.2
  µm filters (microbial samples) to sterile plastic vials.
</para>
          <para>
  Chemical analyses We characterized the chemical properties of the
  water samples at the University of Colorado (Boulder, CO). Ammonia
  (NH3+) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) were analyzed immediately
  upon return to the laboratory. Before freezing, we warmed 50 ml of the
  sample to room temperature and recorded pH. The remaining filtrate was
  frozen (-20°C) until analysis within three months for total dissolved
  nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), and total dissolved
  organic carbon (DOC). We analyzed TDP colorimetrically (Grasshoff et
  al. 2009), TDN with an ion chromatograph, and DOC using a Shimadzu
  model 7100 carbon analyzer. We extracted chlorophyll a (chl-a) from
  the 0.7 µm GF/F filters using the 90% hot ethanol method (Nusch 1980),
  then covered samples in foil and kept refrigerated (4°C) until
  analysis 24 hours later. We then hand-filtered extracted samples
  through Whatman GF/F (pore size 1.2 µm) filters before
  spectrophotometric analysis and corrected final values for
  phaeopigment.
